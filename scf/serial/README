1) To compile the program, type "make".
   a) The following arguments can be passed to make to selectively enable
      various optimizations:
        NO_PRECALC=1      Disable using a lookup table in g
        USE_CACHE=1       Enable caching results of g (conventional method)
        NO_BOOKKEEPING=1  Disables updating computed and work skipped counters
        BLAS=1            Enables BLAS
        LAPACKE=1         Enables LAPACK
    
    b) BLAS support
       cblas.h file and BLAS library must be installed to use BLAS functions.
    
    c) LAPACK support
       The LAPACKE C language wrapper must be installed in addition to the
       LAPACK library itself.

2) To run the program, type "scf.x".

3) The programs input file is be.input.

4) The following optimizations have been included

   a) The 2*pow(pi, 2.50) calculation in g has been replaced with a constant.
   
   b) In function g, the division by expntIJ and expntKL operations has been
      replaced with a multiplication of their inverse.

   c) All arrays are single dimensional with calculated offsets to eliminate
      extra pointer indirection.

   d) contract_matricies has be modified to use a single loop which iterates
      to nbfn*nbfn and uses pointer incrementing.

   e) oneel has been removed from the main iteration loop; instead, the initial
      g_fock matrix is stored during initialization then copied into g_fock
      each iteration. After copying, contract_matricies is performed to
      calculate the one-electron energy contribution.

   f) There is symmetry in g that can be exploited to cut the number of times is it called to approximately
      1/8th. The function calculates the same value when: i and j are swapped, k and l are swapped, i,j and
      k,l are swapped, as well as any combination of those three swap operations.

   g) The calculations in g which only rely on one of the i,j or k,l input
      pairs are precomputed and stored in a lookup table. Implemented in
      g_fast. g_fast is used unless NO_PRECALC=1 is passed to make, in which
      case the standard g function is used.

   h) g and g_fast are inlined functions declared in g.h

   i) The i,j and k,l arguments to g_fast have been replaced with the computed
      ij or kl offset into the table. 

   j) LAPACK functions can be used to find the eigenvalues of a matrix.
      (Requires LAPACKE=1 option to make)
   
   k) BLAS functions can be used for the matrix multiplications and
      vector operations. (Requires BLAS=1 option to make)
