# Intro

SAR

Synthetic-Aperture Radar

# Implementations

## original
This is a copy of the RITSAR implementation, with fixes to allow it to run on
more recent versions of Python.

# Basis for comparison

To keep comparisons clean, the problem size, compiler version and CFLAGS should
be kept consistent for all builds.

## Language version

The code is run using Python version 3.6.9.

## Baseline

Our baseline performance metric will be execution of the AutoFocus demo, using
the Sandia example dataset.
